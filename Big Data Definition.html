<h2>The Definition of Big Data</h2> 
<h3>There is little agreement as to how to describe big data as one of the most 'hyped' words on the industry today. The term is also synonymously used with similar terms such as Business Intelligence ( BI) and data mining. It is accurate because these three words are for analyzing data and in many cases advanced analytics. Yet the definition of big data is different from the other two because data sizes, number of transactions and the amount of data sources are so big and complicated that specific approaches and techniques are needed to obtain information from data ( for example, conventional data warehouse solutions can be limited when  working with big data). This also forms the basis for the most used definition of big data, the three V: Volume, Velocity and Variety as shown in.
    </h3>
<h4><FONT SIZE="4">- Volume: Large amounts of data, from datasets with sizes of terabytes to zettabyte.</FONT>

</h4>
<h5><FONT SIZE="4">- Velocity: Large amounts of data from transactions with high refresh rate resulting in data streams coming at great speed and the time to act on the basis of these data streams will often be very short.  There is a shift from batch processing to real time streaming.</FONT>
</h5>


<h6><FONT SIZE="4">- Variety: Data come from different data sources.  For the first, data can come from both internal and external data source.  More importantly, data can come in various format such as transaction and log data from various applications, structured data as database table, semi-structured data such as XML data, unstructured data such as text, images, video streams, audio statement, and more.  There is a shift from sole structured data to increasingly more unstructured data or the combination of the two.</FONT></h6>

<h7> <FONT SIZE="+2">This leads us to the most widely used definition in the industry. Gartner (2012) defines Big Data in the following. 
    Big data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making, and process automation.
    It is also coming at you fast, it is coming at you in complex format, and it is coming at you from a variety of sources.
     Around now it should be obvious that the "big" in big data is not just about quantity. Although big data is definitely about getting a lot of data, big data is not about data volume alone. What it means is not just that you get a ton of info.   
    It is also important to note that the definition of an absolute threshold for what constitutes big data might not have too much value. The big data of today might not be the big data of tomorrow because of the technology progress. It's a relative concept, on the whole. From the viewpoint of others, whether the company facing major problems (and opportunities) about the dataâ€™s volume, velocity, and variety it is the big data challenge. Such problems usually carry together the need for distinct systems and strategies for data collection and process.</FONT>
