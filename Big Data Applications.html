<H2>Big Data Applications</H2>
<H3><Ul>-	Banking and Securities : The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is using Big Data to monitor financial market activity. They are currently using network analytics and natural language processors to catch illegal trading activity in the financial markets.
    Retail traders, Big banks, hedge funds, and other so-called ‘big boys’ in the financial markets use Big Data for trade analytics used in high-frequency trading, pre-trade decision-support analytics, sentiment measurement, Predictive Analytics, etc.
    </Ul>
<Ul> -	Communications, Media and Entertainment: Simultaneously, companies in this field evaluate consumer data coupled with behavioral data to construct detailed customer profiles that can be used for:
    <ul>• Create content for the different target audiences</ul>
    <ul>• Suggest on-demand content</ul>
    <ul>• Test efficiency of the content </ul>
    </Ul>
  <Ul> - Healthcare Providers: Some hospitals use data from millions of patients that have been collected from a cell phone app to allow doctors to use evidence-based medicine as opposed to administering multiple medical / lab tests to all patients going to the hospital. A research battery may be efficient but it can be inefficient and typically unreliable as well.
    The University of Florida has used free public health data and Google Maps to create visual data that allows for faster identification and efficient analysis of health care information, used to track chronic disease spread.
    </Ul> 
 <Ul>- Education: The use of big data in higher education is quite significant. The University of Tasmania for example. An Australian university of more than 26,000 students has implemented a learning and management program that monitors, among other aspects, as a student signs in to the System, how much time is spent in various sites in the system, as well as a student's average success over time.
    It is also used in a different use case of the use of Big Data in education to measure the effectiveness of teachers to ensure a pleasant experience for both students and teachers. The success of teachers may be fine-tuned and evaluated against numbers of students, subject matter, profiles of students, expectations of students, description of behaviors, and numerous other variables.
    </Ul>   
  <Ul>- Manufacturing and Natural Resources: Big Data allows for predictive modeling in the natural resource industry to support decision-making that has been used to ingest and integrate large amounts of data from geospatial data, graphic data, text, and temporal data. Areas of interest where this was used include; seismic interpretation and characterization of the reservoir.
    Big data has already been used to address today's industrial problems and, gain a competitive advantage, among other benefits.
    </Ul>  
 <Ul> - Government: Big Data has a wide array of applications in public services, including energy exploration, financial market analysis, fraud detection, health-related research, and environmental protection.
    Some more specific examples are as follows:
    Large amounts of social disability claims made to the Social Security Administration ( SSA) that arrive in the form of unstructured data are being analyzed using big data. The analytics are used to quickly and efficiently process medical information for faster decision-making, and to detect suspicious or fraudulent claims.
    Homeland Security Department uses Big Data for various use cases.
Big data is analyzed from various government agencies and is used to protect the country.
