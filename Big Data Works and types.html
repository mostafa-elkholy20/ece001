<h2>How Big Data Works</h2>
<h3>Big data gives you new insights that open up new opportunities and business models. Getting started involves three key actions:</h3>
<h4><FONT SIZE="4">1. Integrate:
    Big data puts data from many various sources and applications. Traditional data integration mechanisms, such as ETL (extract, transform, and load) generally aren’t up to the task. The study of large data sets at terabyte, or even petabyte, size involves different techniques and technology. 
You need to put in the data during integration, process it, and make sure it is structured and accessible in a way that your market analysts can get started.</FONT>
</h4>
<h5><FONT SIZE="4">2. Manage:
    Big data requires storage. You may choose the storage system at the cloud, at the premises, or both. You can store your data in any type you choose and on-demand add bring processing specifications and appropriate process engines to such data sets. Most people pick their option for storage due to where their data is currently residing. The cloud is gradually gaining popularity because it meets the existing computing needs and enables you to spin up resources as needed</FONT>.
    </h5>
 <h6><FONT SIZE="4">‎3. Analyze:
    when you analyze and act on your data, the investment in big data pays off. Provide fresh insight for the diverse data sets visually analyzed. Explore the data further to make new discoveries. Tell others about your findings. Build data models with machine learning and artificial intelligence. Put your data to work.</FONT>
